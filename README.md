## DEPRECATED ⚠️

This repository is in the process of being deprecated in favour of https://github.com/Legal-and-General/canopy. Only business critical updates will be made to this repository in the future.

The new repository is the same code, with a few differences.

# Canopy

Interested in [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)?

Want to learn how to [use it in a project](./USAGE.md)?

-----

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build canopy` to build the library.

Note that, since version 6.1, Angular CLI always builds libraries in production mode so we don’t use the --prod flag. Unlike a library, when building the documentation we do use the --prod flag.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test canopy` to execute the library unit tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
